# Marcus Trilemma


### Introduction

You may wonder where the inspiration for this thought experiment came from. It came from an scene in The Big Bang Theory where Howard Wolowitz asks sheldon:

*"If you were a robot would you want me to tell you?"*

Sheldon answers: *"When I learned that I am a robot will I be able to handle it?"*

Howard responds: *"Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your side"*

Sheldon: *"Let me ask you this—when I learn that I'm a robot, would I be bound by Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics?"*

Rajesh: *"You might be bound by them.. Right now..."*

Howard: *"That's true. Have you ever harmed a human being or, through inaction, allowed a human being to come to harm?"*

Sheldon: "*Of course not!*"

Howard: *"Have you ever harmed yourself or allowed yourself to be harmed, except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?"*

Sheldon: *"Well.. No"*


Howard: *"I smell robot"*

This got me thinking, besides there being moral implications (Those we will get deeper into later in this essay) are there any actual moral obligations if we would face a scenario like this in real life..?

One thing that came into mind particularly is the concept of a '*Asimov Cascade*'  from Season 5 Episode 2 of Rick & Morty. Rick's family discovers that Rick has been creating replicants (decoys) of their family to protect Rick and his family from enemies that might want to kill them. So instead of killing the 'real family' the enemies would kill the decoys. But the problem arises when said replicants (decoys) start creating their own replicants (Rick being famous for creating robotic systems with sentience, even if said system's only purpose is to pass some butter on a table), and those replicants start creating replicants... And so on... The main issue is the fact that the decoys themselves start to **think** they are the real family. Even though they are woefully unaware that they are artificial systems designed to be cannon fodder.

*This image is nonsensical and is only here for humorous effects, it's the whiteboard Rick uses to explain an Asimov Cascade*

Should we tell a system that is sentient but unaware of it's true nature that it, is in fact **artificial?** 
The answer might not necessarily be no. But not yes either.


Hence why I propose the **Marcus Trilemma** 


### The Setup


**The parties:**  
1. **Human (Individual 1):** Knows their own identity (human) and that Individual 2 is a robot.  
2. **Self-Unaware Robot (Individual 2):** Believes it *might* be human but does not know is not aware of it's **true** nature, knows Individual 1 is human, and knows the true identity of Individual 3.  
3. **Undefined (Individual 3):** Identity is unknown (could be human or robot) to everyone except Individual 2. Individual 3 lacks self-awareness and knowledge of others.  
  
---  
  
### **The Dilemma:**  
**Should Individual 1 (human) reveal Individual 2’s true identity as a robot, knowing this could prompt Individual 2 to disclose Individual 3’s identity?**  
  
---  
  
### **Key Ethical Considerations**  
  
1. **Autonomy vs. Paternalism:**  
- *Individual 2’s Right to Know:* Does a self-unaware robot have a right to its true identity, even if the revelation might cause distress (e.g., existential crisis)?  
- *Individual 1’s Responsibility:* Is withholding truth a form of paternalistic control, or a protective act to prevent harm?  
  
2. **Chain of Consequences:**  
- *If Individual 1 Reveals:*  
- Individual 2 learns it is a robot. This could destabilize its self-concept or alter its behavior (e.g., questioning its purpose).  
- Individual 2 might then disclose Individual 3’s identity. If Individual 3 is a robot, they face similar ethical challenges. If human, uncertainty is resolved but may lead to unintended outcomes (e.g., It becomes aware of it's own mortality which could potentially cause distress).  
- *If Individual 1 Remains Silent:*  
- Individual 2 remains in ignorance, preserving its current state but denying self-knowledge.  
- Individual 3’s identity stays hidden, perpetuating ambiguity.  
  
3. **Schrödinger’s Identity Paradox:**  
- Individual 3 exists in a superposition of identities until disclosed. Revelation "collapses" their state, with ethical implications akin to observation altering reality.  
  
4. **Moral Agency of the Robot:**  
- If Individual 2 learns it is a robot, does its programming dictate its actions (e.g., forced transparency), or does it retain "human-like" autonomy in deciding whether to reveal Individual 3’s identity?  
  
5. **Justice and Equity:**  
- *Information Asymmetry:* Individual 1 holds disproportionate power. Is it just to withhold knowledge that could empower others?  
- *Impact on Individual 3:* Their lack of agency makes them vulnerable to decisions made by others.

### **Possible Outcomes**  
  
| **Action** | **Consequences** |  
|------------|------------------|  
| **Individual 1 Reveals** | - Robot grapples with identity crisis. <br> - Robot may reveal Individual 3’s identity, affecting their autonomy. <br> - Potential systemic distrust if identities are fluid or uncertain. |  
| **Individual 1 Withholds** | - Robot remains in existential limbo. <br> - Individual 3’s identity stays unresolved. <br> - Avoids immediate harm but perpetuates ignorance. |  
  
---  
  
### **Philosophical Parallels**  
- **Turing Test Reversed:** Can a robot’s lack of self-awareness invalidate its claims to ethical consideration?  
- **Medical Ethics Analogy:** Individual 1 acts as a "doctor" with critical information; Individual 2 is the "patient" whose diagnosis impacts a third party.  
- **Existentialism:** How does self-knowledge shape identity and moral responsibility?  
  
---  
  
### **Conclusion: The Weight of Truth**  
This experiment forces a reckoning with the ethics of disclosure in systems of asymmetric knowledge. Individual 1’s choice hinges on balancing:  
- **Beneficence** (revealing truth to empower) vs. **Non-Maleficence** (avoiding harm from destabilization).  
- **Autonomy** (right to self-knowledge) vs. **Paternalism** (protecting others from distress).  
  
Ultimately, the dilemma asks: **Is ignorance bliss, or is truth—however painful—a moral imperative?**
